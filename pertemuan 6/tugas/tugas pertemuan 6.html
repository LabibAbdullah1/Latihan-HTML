    <p class="prg-first"> With the development and application of new information
      technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and artificial
      intelligence, data security and privacy protection has become an
      urgent and crucial issue. With more and more tenants (including
      individuals, enterprises, and government organizations) deploy
      ing important data and critical applications to the cloud, trust
      in cloud service providers has become an emergent security
      issue. While there are many mature security mechanisms for
      data at rest or in transit in the cloud computing, protecting
      data in use will face the significant technical challenge and
      is an open problem. Confidential computing is an innovative
      security technology that has been introduced to address this
      issue</p>
    <p> fidential computing has become a popular technology area
      driven by both government policy and industry. Both in the
      technologies and products, confidential computing is also in
      a rapid growth stage. According to the ‘Privacy Computing
      White Paper’ released by the Privacy Computing Alliance in
      2022, it is anticipated that confidential computing and
      privacy protection technologies will be commercialized in a
      large scale in the next 5 to 10 years. The report also predicts
      that by 2025, over 60% of large organizations will use one
      or more privacy protection technologies in scenarios such as
      data analysis, business intelligence, or cloud computing. Cur
      rently, confidential computing applications are already involved
      in industries such as finance, communication, government,
      and healthcare. Notably, major global IT companies have
      invested in the direction of confidential computing technology,
      and released a number of significant application achieve
      ments, such as Microsoft Azure Confidential Computing,
      Google Cloud’s GKE, Alibaba Cloud’s ECS, Ant Finan
      cial’s Occlum and KubeTEE, Huawei’s Kunpeng BoostKit,
      and so on.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Data owner</li>
      <p> This entity is responsible for storing, man
        aging, and controlling large amounts of sensitive data, and
        has absolute ownership over the data. They determine
        who can access the data, which typically contains sensi
        tive information that must not be leaked,tampered with, or
        used unlawfully</p>
      <li>Code owner</li>
      <p>Thisentitycreatesprograms,algorithms, mod
        els, and other code for accessing, computing, and analysing.
        They typically have strong research and development capa
        bilities but lack actual data. They usually hope to gain as
        much access to data as possible, while hoping that their code
        is not illegally tampered with or destroyed.</p>
      <li> Platform owner</li>
      <p> This entity combines hardware (sourced
        from hardware suppliers such as CPU manufacturers, server
        manufacturers, and so on), system software (including OS
        and hypervisor suppliers), and critical services (such as cloud
        middleware suppliers). They construct a cloud environment
        and establish a confidential computing platform to provide
        confidential computing functions and services to external
        entities.</p>
      <li> Consumer</li>
      <p>This entity has actual demand for the confi
        dential computing platform and services. They rely on data
        provided by data owners and code provided by code authors,
        and use the managementfunctions andsoftware provided by
        platform owners to complete their confidential computing
        needs</p>
